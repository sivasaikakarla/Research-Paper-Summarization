Synthesis of Physics papers: Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) provides long-term health monitoring. This monitoring requires low-power operation of invasive/non-invasive sensor nodes. A power-efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is required to satisfy the stringent WBAN requirements. CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Please submit your best shots of the U.S. for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel each week for a new gallery of snapshots.

It is argued that theoretical physics is more akin to an organism than to a rigid structure. It is in this sense that the epithet, "sick", applies to it. The malady is located in the relationship between mathematics and physical meaning in physical theory.

Physical theory is treated as a conceptual organism which develops under the weight of its internal contradictions. The paper discusses in depth the problem of objective reality in physics and its relation to scientific practice. It explores the problematic relation between physical meaning and mathematics in modern physical theory.

Optimization of three-dimensional micropost microcavities for cavity quantum electrodynamics Jelena VuËckoviÂ´c, Matthew Pelton, Axel Scherer, and Yoshihisa Yamamoto Quantum Entanglement Project, ICORP, JST. We show that some of the emitting diodes, low-threshold lasers, and single photon rules that work well for designing large-diameter micro- sources. A powerful property of solid-state microcavi- posts (e.g., high-refractive index contrast) fail to pro- ties is that a single narrow-linewidth emitter (quantum vide high-qualitycavities with smalldiameters) can be embedded i.
