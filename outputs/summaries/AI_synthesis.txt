Synthesis of AI papers: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically annotate human emotions in everyday scenarios. Under a seven-class emotion taxonomy, the LLM achieved an average precision of approximately 50%. In contrast, when limited to ternary emotion classification (negative/neutral/positive), the average precision increased to approximately 64%.  LLMs offer new avenues for reducing labeling costs and broadening the applicability of LLMs in complex multimodal environments.  emotion annotation tasks, offering new avenues to reduce labeling costs. emotion annotations can be used to identify emotions in a variety of ways.

Hypernetworks, or hypernets for short, are neural networks that generate weights for another neural network, known as the target network. They have emerged in recent years as a way to test new types of networks. They can also be used to test the performance of existing networks.
