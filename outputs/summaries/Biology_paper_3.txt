Natural similarity in body dimensions of terrestrial animals noticed by ancient philosophers remains the main key to the problem of mammalian skeletal evolution. We revise the fundamental assumptions underlying these similarities and give new physical insights into geometric-shape and elastic-force constraints imposed on spatial evolution of mammalian long bones.
