Optimization of three-dimensional micropost microcavities for cavity quantum electrodynamics Jelena Vuˇckovi´c, Matthew Pelton, Axel Scherer, and Yoshihisa Yamamoto Quantum Entanglement Project, ICORP, JST. We show that some of the emitting diodes, low-threshold lasers, and single photon rules that work well for designing large-diameter micro- sources. A powerful property of solid-state microcavi- posts (e.g., high-refractive index contrast) fail to pro- ties is that a single narrow-linewidth emitter (quantum vide high-qualitycavities with smalldiameters) can be embedded i. High atom has refractive indices of high atom[15]. Duetoimperfectionsinfabricatedstructures, and low refractive index regions, and the cavity diam- un-optimized structure parameters. We are able to achieve Q as high as 104, together precisely control position of a quantum dot. Spontaneous emission is not an intrinsic property of an atoms.
