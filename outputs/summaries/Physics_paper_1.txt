Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) provides long-term health monitoring. This monitoring requires low-power operation of invasive/non-invasive sensor nodes. A power-efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is required to satisfy the stringent WBAN requirements. CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Please submit your best shots of the U.S. for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel each week for a new gallery of snapshots.
