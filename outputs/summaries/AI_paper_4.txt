The comprehension and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are beset with practical and ethical problems. This article presents a 5-level AI Capability Assessment Model (AI-CAM) and a related AI Capabilities Matrix ( AI-CM) These tools were developed with business executives, technologists, and other organisational stakeholders in mind. Business, data, technology, organisation, AI skills, risks, and ethical considerations are required to achieve optimal use of AI in organisations. There are five maturity levels to achieve optimum use ofAI in organisations: business,Data, Technology, Organisation, and AI skills.
