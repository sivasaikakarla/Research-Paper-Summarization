With advanced AI/ML, there has been growing research on explainable AI (XAI) and studies on how humans interact with AI. We still have a lack of understanding of how AI systems and XAI should be first presented to users without technical backgrounds. In this paper, we present the findings of semi-structured interviews with health professionals. We highlight directions for improving onboarding with AI and XAI and human-AI collaborative decision-making. Based on these findings, we highlight ways to improve onboarding for XAI.
