In this Chapter, we ask questions (1) What is the right way to measure the quality of information processing in a biological system? and (2) What can real-life organisms do to improve their performance in information-processing tasks? We then review the body of work that investigates these questions experimentally, computationally, and theoretically in biological domains as diverse as cell biology, population biology, and computational neuroscience.
