Synthesis of Biology papers: In this Chapter, we ask questions (1) What is the right way to measure the quality of information processing in a biological system? and (2) What can real-life organisms do to improve their performance in information-processing tasks? We then review the body of work that investigates these questions experimentally, computationally, and theoretically in biological domains as diverse as cell biology, population biology, and computational neuroscience.

This technical monograph provides a comprehensive overview of the field of quantum biology. It approaches quantum biology from a physical perspective with core quantum mechanical concepts presented foremost to provide a theoretical foundation for the field. This lays the essential groundwork to enable further advances in nanomedicine and biotechnology. Written for academics, biological science researchers, physicists, biochemists, medical technologists and students of quantum mechanics.

Natural similarity in body dimensions of terrestrial animals noticed by ancient philosophers remains the main key to the problem of mammalian skeletal evolution. We revise the fundamental assumptions underlying these similarities and give new physical insights into geometric-shape and elastic-force constraints imposed on spatial evolution of mammalian long bones.

The (quantitative) systems biology offers the potential to solve the Borges Dilemma, by transcending it. I reason here that the known folk law that there is no general law in biology because of exceptions is false. There have already a plenty of indications on this trend.
