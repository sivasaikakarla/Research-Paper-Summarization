This study investigates the feasibility and performance of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically annotate human emotions in everyday scenarios. Under a seven-class emotion taxonomy, the LLM achieved an average precision of approximately 50%. In contrast, when limited to ternary emotion classification (negative/neutral/positive), the average precision increased to approximately 64%.  LLMs offer new avenues for reducing labeling costs and broadening the applicability of LLMs in complex multimodal environments.  emotion annotation tasks, offering new avenues to reduce labeling costs. emotion annotations can be used to identify emotions in a variety of ways.
